# The Algorithm

I am operating under the assumption that the policy itself is out of the programmer's hands;
that is, the airline is still insisting upon charging extra for the ability to choose seats.



One priority I would consider is that young children should always be seated with at least
one adult in their party and should never be seated at an emergency exit row. The algorithm 
should have an indicator attached for whether a passenger is young enough to require this, and 
assign these duos before the random-assignment stage.

Ideally, parties that book together should be kept together when possible; an algorithm that 
searches for the required number of adjacent seats or seats in adjacent rows would reduce 
anxiety for groups. It would also allow greater flexibility for people to switch seats according 
to need within that group. If this is impossible, then people should be grouped with at least 
one other party member if possible so that no one party member is separated from the rest.

# Impact on Equity

On the one hand, this plan is not foolproof. If the individually selected seats in the 
economy-plus phase do not allow for adjacent seats to be booked when children are involved,
then those children would still be separated from an adult. Furthermore, there is no good
method for ensuring that people with additional needs (such as disability, advanced age, or
pregnancy) would have access to a seat that enables those needs to be met. An adult with a 
disability may need to be with another person, and there is no clear avenue for ensuring that
those passengers will be able to receive that accommodation.

However, this would improve the likelihood that children will be seated with an adult by
seating them before the rest of the random assignment occurs, and will also improve the chances
of party members being seated together in general. If it is willing to do so, the airline could 
introduce a toggle when booking tickets for whether the passenger needs to sit with another 
member of the party so that those parties can be seated before general assignment.
